Hi 👋 My name is Lewis Giachardi
================================

Data analyst
------------

I'm new to data analysis, but I have been using and fiddling with computers and code for years. With a whole family of coders and IT security specialists, I've gathered a broad stroke of knowledge for most areas in IT, but most of my knowledge is not highly specialised.

*   🌍  I'm based in Sunderland, England
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [lgiachal@gmail.com](mailto:lgiachal@gmail.com)
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on any projects that allow me to explore a sector of IT I haven't had much experience in
